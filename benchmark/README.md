# Benchmark

This is a simple benchmark based on [js-framework-benchmark](https://github.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark).

To run it in place, you need to clone `js-framework-benchmark` and copy / link the `css` folder to the root of the denier project:

```
ln -s /path/to/js-framework-benchmark/css /path/to/denier
```

Then, use `npm start bench` to serve.
